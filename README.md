# This app was vibe-coded

This description was not...

I wanted to see how far I could make it developing an app I've wanted to work on for a while, without writing a single line of code myself. The answer? FAR, very far.

Then it hit me: what if anyone who downloads the app can also help me "vibe" it?

**This app ships with the ability for anyone using it to build on top of it in any way they'd like. I call it, Vibe².**
